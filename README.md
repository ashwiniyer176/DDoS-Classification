# DDoS-Classification

This is a personal project on classifying Distributed Denial of Service Attacks (DDoS Attacks) using Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

1. Dataset: [Link](http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/mfnn9bh42m.1#file-ba7d3a46-1dc3-452e-aeac-26d909389b29) to the dataset <br>
2. Structure: Create a folder called `data` in the root and download.
3. Run the **Data_Building.ipynb** notebook to get the split datasets as well as a combined dataset. :)
